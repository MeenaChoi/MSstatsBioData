\title{Time course investigation of central carbon metabolism of \emph{S. cerevisiae}}
\description{
45 proteins in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis/TCA cycle/glyoxylate cycle network were targeted in SRM experiment with isotope labeled reference peptides. Three biological replicates were measured at ten time points (T1-T10, labeled as 1 to 10 in Condition column). There are total 30 MS runs measured. It covered dynamic growth phases of \emph{S. cerevisiae}, in a glucose-rich medium (T1-T4), diauxic shift (T5-T6), post-diauxic phase (T7-T9), and stationary phase (T10). Each transition was quantified automatically using MultiQuant with no missing values.
