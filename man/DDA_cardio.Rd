\title{Dataset of cardiovascular disease study}
\description{
This study is for investigation for cardiovascular disease between control and four disease stages.  (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in Condition) 246 samples from control and disease patients were analyzed with single injection by label- free DDA as described in 15. There are 97 identified proteins. The dataset was processed by Monarch, (http: //www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=20704167). Unusually, this DDA dataset had no missing values because the procedure reported the background signal if a feature in a run was not detected.
